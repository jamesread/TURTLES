# The TURTLES checklist

This is a checklist of helpful reminders to document when you come to archiving a project. Hopefully, by documenting a bit more at the time of archiving a project, it will serve as helpful context for those people who find (or come back) to the project in the future. 

This GitHub repository contains a markdown TEMPLATE that you can use when archiving your own projects. 

This approach of creating an archiving checklist was originally described by James Read in this blog post. This GitHub repository came afterwards, with a template, as it's a bit more usable for GitHub developers (and easier to contribute) than copying from the blog post.
