# The TURTLES checklist :turtle: 

The TURTLES checklist is a set of reminders to document when you come to archiving a project. Hopefully, by documenting a bit more at the time of archiving a project, it will serve as helpful context for those people who find (or come back) to the project in the future. 

This GitHub repository contains a [markdown TEMPLATE](TEMPLATE.md) that you can use when archiving your own projects. 

This approach of creating an archiving checklist was originally described by James Read in this blog post. This GitHub repository came afterwards, with a template, as it's a bit more usable for GitHub developers (and easier to contribute) than copying from the blog post. 

## Quick high level reference

- **T — Technologists**: Do enough people contribute to maintaining this project? Developers, Architects, Security, Operations?
- **U — Users**: Does this project have enough active users?
- **R — Requirements**: Is this project still doing what we set out for it to do?
- **T — Technology**: Are there any unsustainable technologies behind this project?
- **L — Learning**: Is anything being learned by maintaining this project? (See my article about Odyssey projects — sometimes “just coding to learn” is enough of a reason to keep a project going).
- **E — Ecosystem**: Is there an alternative to writing this project?
- **S — Salvage**: Can anything useful be salvaged from this project?

A full [markdown TEMPLATE](TEMPLATE.md) contains many more prompts under this same structure. 

## Usage

It is hoped that people who have found this useful will add links to their documented TURTLES checklist in the [USAGE][USAGE.md] file.
