# The TURTLES checklist :turtle: 

The TURTLES checklist is a set of reminders to document when you come to archiving a project. Hopefully, by documenting a bit more at the time of archiving a project, it will serve as helpful context for those people who find (or come back) to the project in the future. 

This GitHub repository contains a [markdown TEMPLATE](TEMPLATE.md) that you can use when archiving your own projects. 

This approach of creating an archiving checklist was originally described by James Read in [this blog post](https://blog.jread.com/how-to-properly-archive-a-project-48ddbd0208f8). This GitHub repository came afterwards, with a template, as it's a bit more usable for GitHub developers (and easier to contribute) than copying from the blog post. 

## Quick high level sneak-peak

- **T — Technologists**: Did enough people contribute to maintaining this project? Developers, Architects, Security, Operations?
- **U — Users**: Did this project have enough active users?
- **R — Requirements**: Was this project still doing what we set out for it to do?
- **T — Technology**: Are there any unsustainable technologies behind this project? 
- **L — Learning**: Was anything being learned by maintaining this project? 
- **E — Ecosystem**: Is there now an alternative to writing this project?
- **S — Salvage**: Can anything useful be salvaged from this project?

A full [markdown TEMPLATE](TEMPLATE.md) contains many more prompts under this same structure.

## Usage

It is hoped that people who have found this useful will add links to their documented TURTLES checklist in the [USAGE](USAGE.md) file.
